They are useful both to compute solutions for a large number of parameter values (e.g. for parameter fitting) and to approximate a solution for a new parameter value (e.g. real time approximation with a very high accuracy). They aim at reducing the computational costs of High Fidelity (HF) codes. They require well chosen solutions, called snapshots, preliminary computed (e.g. offline) with a HF classical method, involving, e.g. a fine mesh (finite element or finite volume) and generally require a profound modification of the HF code, in order for the online computation to be performed in short (or even real) time. In this paper, we will focus on the Non-Intrusive Reduced Basis (NIRB) two-grid method. Its main advantage is its efficient way of using the HF code exclusively as a “black-box”, unlike other so-called intrusive methods which require a modification of the code. This is very convenient when the HF code is a commercial one and has been purchased, as is often the case in the industry. The effectiveness of this method relies on its decomposition into two stages, one offline (classical in most RBMs as presented above) and one online. The offline part is time-consuming but it is executed only once. On the contrary, the specificity of the NIRB approach is to solve, during the online part, the parametric problem on a coarse mesh only, and then to improve its precision. It is thus much cheaper than a HF evaluation. This method has been initially developed in the context of elliptic equations with finite element and has been extended to finite volume. In this paper, we generalize the NIRB two-grid method to parabolic equations. To the best of our knowledge, the two-grid method has not already been studied in the context of time-dependent problems. With a model problem, which is the heat equation, we recover optimal estimates in $L^{\\infty}(0, T; H^1(\\Omega))$, and present numerical results.","tags":[],"title":"Error estimate of the Non-Intrusive Reduced Basis (NIRB) two-grid method with parabolic equations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Elise Grosjean"],"categories":null,"content":" Talk on non-intrusive reduced basis methods applied to parabolic equations.

They usually are decomposed in two stages. One stage is done offline and can be considered as a learning procedure where a Reduced Basis (RB) is built from several solutions, called snapshots, computed with a high fidelity (HF) classical method, involving, e.g. a fine mesh (finite element or finite volume). In the second stage, which is online and has to be very cheap, a reduced basis problem is solved. The efficiency of the RBM relies on the ability, offline, to prepare the online step. In this article, we consider a Non-Intrusive RBM (NIRB) which is the two grids method. One fine mesh is used to construct the snapshots for the generation of the RB. Then, in the online part, the NIRB algorithm involves a coarse mesh where the problem solution for a new parameter is approximated and is $L^2$-projected on the RB. We adapt the NIRB algorithm to improve the accuracy and to further reduce the complexity of the online part, in particular by using a \\emph{domain truncation}. We exploit the fact that the solutions of parameterized problems behave physically similarly for a suitable range of parameters. We create two RB and a deterministic (algebraic) process which allows us to pass from one to the other. This new algorithm is applied to the 2D backward facing step. The second aim of this article is to deal with \\emph{singularities}. The domain geometry produces a fluid recirculation zone that must be captured correctly, for instance with a refinement of the mesh. The two-grid method in the FEM context is applied with a new stategy in order to counterbalance the effects of the singularities. The channel domain considered in the model problem has one re-entrant corner and thus the convergence is not optimal with uniform meshes. Thus, the theory of the two-grid method does not applied. However, we present several numerical results with fine refined meshes where both NIRB approaches succeed in retrieving the fine FEM accuracy.","tags":[],"title":"A doubly reduced approximation for the solution to PDEs based on a domain truncation and a reduced basis method: Application to Navier-Stokes equations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Elise Grosjean"],"categories":null,"content":" Presentation on optimizations of a non-intrusive reduced basis method Program ","date":1632182400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1632182400,"objectID":"5f725f33c23522440157b626409b9b9c","permalink":"https://grosjean1.github.io/talk/workshop-mathematics-of-high-performance-computing/","publishdate":"2021-09-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/workshop-mathematics-of-high-performance-computing/","section":"event","summary":"Talk on optimizations of a non-intrusive reduced basis method","tags":[],"title":"Workshop Mathematics of High-Performance Computing","type":"event"},{"authors":["Elise Grosjean"],"categories":null,"content":" Presentation on optimizations of a non-intrusive reduced basis method Program ","date":1632182400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1632182400,"objectID":"4823a1af2ee284f63b5f46e6b739d6e1","permalink":"https://grosjean1.github.io/talk/workshopmathematicshighperformancecomputing/","publishdate":"2021-09-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/workshopmathematicshighperformancecomputing/","section":"talk","summary":"Talk on optimizations of a non-intrusive reduced basis method","tags":[],"title":"Workshop Mathematics of High-Performance Computing","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Elise Grosjean","Yvon Maday"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1625097600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625097600,"objectID":"a547b42cd6db23fe12bbe4f591488f4d","permalink":"https://grosjean1.github.io/publication/publi1/","publishdate":"2021-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/publi1/","section":"publication","summary":"The context of this paper is the simulation of parameter-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs). When the aim is to solve such PDEs for a large number of parameter values, Reduced Basis Methods (RBM) are often used to reduce computational costs of a classical high fidelity code based on Finite Element Method (FEM), Finite Volume (FVM) or Spectral methods. The efficient implementation of most of these RBM requires to modify this high fidelity code, which cannot be done, for example in an industrial context if the high fidelity code is only accessible as a \"black-box\" solver. The Non-Intrusive Reduced Basis (NIRB) method has been introduced in the context of finite elements as a good alternative to reduce the implementation costs of these parameter-dependent problems. The method is efficient in other contexts than the FEM one, like with finite volume schemes, which are more often used in an industrial environment. In this case, some adaptations need to be done as the degrees of freedom in FV methods have different meanings. At this time, error estimates have only been studied with FEM solvers. In this paper, we present a generalisation of the NIRB method to Finite Volume schemes and we show that estimates established for FEM solvers also hold in the FVM setting. We first prove our results for the hybrid-Mimetic Finite Difference method (hMFD), which is part the Hybrid Mixed Mimetic methods (HMM) family. Then, we explain how these results apply more generally to other FV schemes. Some of them are specified, such as the Two Point Flux Approximation (TPFA).","tags":[],"title":"Error estimate of the Non-Intrusive Reduced Basis method with finite volume schemes, ESAIM: M2AN 55 (2021) 1941–1961","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Elise Grosjean","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
