For highly complex parametric problems, these two approaches may become too costly. To reduce computational times, Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and Reduced Basis Methods (RBMs) have already been investigated. The majority of these algorithms are however intrusive in the sense that the High-Fidelity (HF) code must be modified. To address this issue, non-intrusive strategies are employed. The NIRB two-grid method uses the HF code solely as a ``black-box'', requiring no code modification. Like other RBMs, it is based on an offline-online decomposition. The offline stage is time-consuming, but it is only executed once, whereas the online stage is significantly less expensive than an HF evaluation. In this paper, we propose new NIRB two-grid algorithms for both the direct and adjoint state methods. On a classical model problem, the heat equation, we prove that HF evaluations of sensitivities reach an optimal convergence rate in L∞(0,T;H1(Ω)), and then establish that these rates are recovered by the proposed NIRB approximations. These results are supported by numerical simulations. We then numerically demonstrate that a further deterministic post-treatment can be applied to the direct method. This further reduces computational costs of the online step while only computing a coarse solution of the initial problem. All numerical results are run with the model problem as well as a more complex problem, namely the Brusselator system.","tags":[],"title":"Error estimate of the non-intrusive reduced basis two-grid method applied to sensitivity analysis (M2AN)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Elise Grosjean","Yvon Maday"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1701388800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1701388800,"objectID":"1b5cc9e4fcdcba6d5677c2203abed7e4","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/publi3/","publishdate":"2023-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/publi3/","section":"publication","summary":"Reduced Basis Methods (RBMs) are frequently proposed to approximate parametric problem solutions. They can be used to calculate solutions for a large number of parameter values (e.g. for parameter fitting) as well as to approximate a solution for a new parameter value (e.g. real time approximation with a very high accuracy). They intend to reduce the computational costs of High Fidelity (HF) codes. We will focus on the Non-Intrusive Reduced Basis (NIRB) two-grid method. Its main advantage is that it uses the HF code exclusively as a \"black-box,\" as opposed to other so-called intrusive methods that require code modification. This is very convenient when the HF code is a commercial one that has been purchased, as is frequently the case in the industry. The effectiveness of this method relies on its decomposition into two stages, one offline (classical in most RBMs as presented above) and one online. The offline part is time-consuming but it is only performed once. On the contrary, the specificity of this NIRB approach is that, during the online part, it solves the parametric problem on a coarse mesh only and then improves its precision. As a result, it is significantly less expensive than a HF evaluation. This method has been originally developed for elliptic equations with finite elements and has since been extended to finite volume. In this paper, we extend the NIRB two-grid method to parabolic equations. We recover optimal estimates in L∞(0,T;H1(Ω)) using as a model problem, the heat equation. Then, we present numerical results on the heat equation and on the Brusselator problem.","tags":[],"title":"Error estimate of the Non-Intrusive Reduced Basis (NIRB) two-grid method with parabolic equations, SMAI: JCM 9 (2023) 227-256","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Elise Grosjean"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1695168000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1695168000,"objectID":"2dc838b15c2eced37e8a4a899f7dfb2f","permalink":"https://example.com/talk/iccb2023/","publishdate":"2023-09-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/iccb2023/","section":"event","summary":"Meniscus tissue regeneration and sensitivity RB approach","tags":[],"title":"ICCB2023","type":"event"},{"authors":["Elise Grosjean"],"categories":null,"content":" Presentation on the numerical aspects of a Coupled analysis of active biological processes for meniscus tissue regeneration Program ","date":1694476800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1694476800,"objectID":"0077ad4633c0f96be434e89651bfb232","permalink":"https://example.com/talk/spp2311-kick-off/","publishdate":"2023-09-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/spp2311-kick-off/","section":"event","summary":"Coupled analysis of active biological processes for meniscus tissue regeneration","tags":[],"title":"SPP2311-Kick-off","type":"event"},{"authors":["Elise Grosjean","Bernd Simeon","Christina Surulescu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1692576000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1692576000,"objectID":"cf9d6b2158984e041997d7bb62d1e155","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/publi5/","publishdate":"2023-08-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/publi5/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose a continuous model for meniscus cartilage regeneration triggered by two populations of cells migrating and (de)differentiating within an artificial scaffold with a known structure.

They usually are decomposed in two stages. One stage is done offline and can be considered as a learning procedure where a Reduced Basis (RB) is built from several solutions, called snapshots, computed with a high fidelity (HF) classical method, involving, e.g. a fine mesh (finite element or finite volume). In the second stage, which is online and has to be very cheap, a reduced basis problem is solved. The efficiency of the RBM relies on the ability, offline, to prepare the online step. In this article, we consider a Non-Intrusive RBM (NIRB) which is the two grids method. One fine mesh is used to construct the snapshots for the generation of the RB. Then, in the online part, the NIRB algorithm involves a coarse mesh where the problem solution for a new parameter is approximated and is $L^2$-projected on the RB. We adapt the NIRB algorithm to improve the accuracy and to further reduce the complexity of the online part, in particular by using a \\emph{domain truncation}. We exploit the fact that the solutions of parameterized problems behave physically similarly for a suitable range of parameters. We create two RB and a deterministic (algebraic) process which allows us to pass from one to the other. This new algorithm is applied to the 2D backward facing step. The second aim of this article is to deal with \\emph{singularities}. The domain geometry produces a fluid recirculation zone that must be captured correctly, for instance with a refinement of the mesh. The two-grid method in the FEM context is applied with a new stategy in order to counterbalance the effects of the singularities. The channel domain considered in the model problem has one re-entrant corner and thus the convergence is not optimal with uniform meshes. Thus, the theory of the two-grid method does not applied. However, we present several numerical results with fine refined meshes where both NIRB approaches succeed in retrieving the fine FEM accuracy.","tags":[],"title":"A doubly reduced approximation for the solution to PDEs based on a domain truncation and a reduced basis method: Application to Navier-Stokes equations (preprint)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Elise Grosjean"],"categories":null,"content":" Presentation on optimizations of a non-intrusive reduced basis method Program ","date":1632182400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1632182400,"objectID":"5f725f33c23522440157b626409b9b9c","permalink":"https://example.com/talk/workshop-mathematics-of-high-performance-computing/","publishdate":"2021-09-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/workshop-mathematics-of-high-performance-computing/","section":"event","summary":"Talk on optimizations of a non-intrusive reduced basis method","tags":[],"title":"Workshop Mathematics of High-Performance Computing","type":"event"},{"authors":["Elise Grosjean","Yvon Maday"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1625097600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625097600,"objectID":"a547b42cd6db23fe12bbe4f591488f4d","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/publi1/","publishdate":"2021-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/publi1/","section":"publication","summary":"The context of this paper is the simulation of parameter-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs). When the aim is to solve such PDEs for a large number of parameter values, Reduced Basis Methods (RBM) are often used to reduce computational costs of a classical high fidelity code based on Finite Element Method (FEM), Finite Volume (FVM) or Spectral methods. The efficient implementation of most of these RBM requires to modify this high fidelity code, which cannot be done, for example in an industrial context if the high fidelity code is only accessible as a \"black-box\" solver. The Non-Intrusive Reduced Basis (NIRB) method has been introduced in the context of finite elements as a good alternative to reduce the implementation costs of these parameter-dependent problems. The method is efficient in other contexts than the FEM one, like with finite volume schemes, which are more often used in an industrial environment. In this case, some adaptations need to be done as the degrees of freedom in FV methods have different meanings. At this time, error estimates have only been studied with FEM solvers. In this paper, we present a generalisation of the NIRB method to Finite Volume schemes and we show that estimates established for FEM solvers also hold in the FVM setting. We first prove our results for the hybrid-Mimetic Finite Difference method (hMFD), which is part the Hybrid Mixed Mimetic methods (HMM) family. Then, we explain how these results apply more generally to other FV schemes. Some of them are specified, such as the Two Point Flux Approximation (TPFA).","tags":[],"title":"Error estimate of the Non-Intrusive Reduced Basis method with finite volume schemes, ESAIM: M2AN 55 (2021) 1941–1961","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Elise Grosjean"],"categories":null,"content":" Talk on non intrusive reduced basis methods applied to finite volume schemes.
